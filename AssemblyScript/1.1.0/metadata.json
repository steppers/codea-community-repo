    "description": "Interface for AssemblyScript's compiler toolchain.\n\nFeatures include:\n- AssemblyScript compilation\n- Dependency management\n- JavaScript based imports allowing AssemblyScript to call back into JS & Lua.\n- Inline JS function definitions inside AssemblyScript code.\n- Load compiled AssemblyScript into a WebView.\n- Call exported functions of a loaded AssemblyScript module.\n- Save compiled AssemblyScript to disk.\n- Load pre-compiled AssemblyScript from disk.\n\nNote: Due to the nature of the JavaScript libraries involved this requires an internet connection while compiling AssemblyScript. Loading precompiled AssemblyScript does not though!",
