    "description": "'Notifications'... What more is there to say?\n\nOnly local notifications are currently supported so no remote push-notifications for now.\n\nNotifications can be given a title & description to be displayed on the notification along with a userinfo table for use by your project. All notifications much specify the delay in seconds before they will be displayed.\n\nAPI (All functions follow 'Notifications.'):\n\n- setup(function(hasPermission))\n    Must be called first. Will present the notifications permission dialog if necessary.\n\n- scheduleNotification(title, desc, delay, userinfo)\n    Schedules a notification to be sent after the specified number of seconds. \n    Returns the identifier of the notification.\n\n- cancelNotifications(identifier | [identifier])\n    Cancels notifications matching the provided identifiers.\n\n- cancelAllNotifications()\n    Cancels all notifications scheduled by the current project.\n\n- getPendingNotifications(function(notifications))\n    Returns to the callback a key-value table with notification identifiers as keys and userinfo tables as values.\n",
