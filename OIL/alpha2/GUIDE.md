# Oil
### A Super 'Slick' and versatile Codea GUI library with an emphasis on ease of use.

---

Inspired by the work of art that is [Soda](https://github.com/Utsira/Soda) and feeling like it was lacking some features I wanted to use during the development of [WebRepo 2.0](https://github.com/steppers/codea-community-repo/tree/main/WebRepo/2.0) I set about to develop my own easy to use GUI library.

Oil is designed to handle all of the grunt work involved with generating beautiful user interfaces, providing a powerful styling system that is pre-configured with both light & dark themes that look great. Say goodbye to configuring everything by hand!

3 lines* is all it takes to create a useful button using Oil:
```
Oil.TextButton(0.5, 0.5, 100, 100, "I'm a button!", function(bttn)
        print("I was pressed!")
end)
```

With a few lines of boilerplate to handle input events and Oil's draw cycle you'll be creating amazing GUIs in no time!
