# Cpdea Community Project Repository
Repository of projects created by the community of the iOS app ‘Codea’

# Getting Started
To get started using the repository, download the WebRepo project (link required) and run it from within Codea.

Simple as that! You should now have access to many user created Codea projects available to download, run & edit all from within Codea itself.

# Submitting a project
To submit a project and have it added to the repo, please export your project from within Codea to generate a .zip file, the zip file will then need to be extracted to produce a single '.codea' project bundle.
Once you have the project bundle, please submit a pull request containing the bundle. Someone with admin access for the repository should eb able to take it from there.

Please note that attempts to submit malicious, unethical or innappropriate content will be ignored.
