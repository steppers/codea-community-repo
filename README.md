# Codea Community Project Repository
Repository of projects created by the community of the iOS app [Codea](https://codea.io)

# Getting Started
To get started using the repository, download the [WebRepo project](https://github.com/steppers/codea-community-repo/releases) to your iOS device and run it from within Codea.

Simple as that! You should now have access to many user created Codea projects available to Download, Run & Edit all from within Codea itself.

To top it all off, if there's an update to the WebRepo project, it'll update itself automatically!

# Submitting a project
To submit a project and have it added to the repo, please export your project from within Codea to generate a .zip file, the zip file will then need to be extracted to produce a single '.codea' project bundle.

Once you have the project bundle please do one of the following:
 - Submit a pull request containing the bundle. Someone with write access to the repository should be able to take it from there. (Easiest for large projects > 10MB)
 - Send me a direct message on [Codea.io](https://codea.io/talk/profile/36722/Steppers)

As only I currently have write access to the repository please be patient when it comes to submitting apps. I hope to bring others on board too if this gets enough interest.

Please note that attempts to submit malicious, unethical or innappropriate content will be ignored.
