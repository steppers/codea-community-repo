# Codea Community Project Repository
Repository of projects created by the community of the iOS app [Codea](https://codea.io)

# Getting Started
To get started using the repository, download the [WebRepo project](https://github.com/steppers/codea-community-repo/releases) to your iOS device and run it from within Codea.

Simple as that! You should now have access to many user created Codea projects available to Download, Run & Edit all from within Codea itself.

To top it all off, if there's an update to the WebRepo project, it'll ask you at launch if you want to update!

# Submitting a project
To submit a project, fill in the required fields on the Submit New Project screen (these are saved between launches). Once you've filled it all in hit the 'Upload & Submit' button and wait for it to tell you it's done!

Once submitted, your project will not be available until an Admin approves your project. I'll endeavour to get this done within 24 hours but if it takes much longer feel free to leave a comment on the Codea forum.
